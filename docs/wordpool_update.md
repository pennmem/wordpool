# Update to the FR/CatFR word pools

In January 2018 we updated the FR and CatFR word pools to enable inclusion of
practice list words into the full word pool. Previously the practice list had
been fixed. While making this update we replaced words that were overlapping
between the FR and CatFR wordpools. We also added an additional category to the
CatFR wordpool, to replace the previously fixed practice list.

## Updating the FR wordpool to replace overlapping words

To replace the words that overlapped between the FR and CatFR word pools, we
used words from the ltpFR2 scalp lab study. We selected words based on the
following criteria:

-   One syllable
-   Highly recallable
-   Not in the FR or CatFR wordpools

Satisfying these criteria produced the set of words below (proportion recall
across the ltpFR2 study indicated next to each word; \[max, min\] recall for the
set is \[0.685, 0.371\]).

## Adding FABRIC category to the CatFR wordpool

To add a new category to the CatFR wordpool, we used the norms reported in Van
Overschelde JP, Rawson KA & Dunlosky J (2004). Category norms: an updated and
expanded version of the Battig and Montague (1969) norms.  *Journal of Memory
and Language*, 50, 289-335. We selected a category that did not overlap with the
existing CatFR wordpool, was not obviously emotionally valenced (e.g. *weapons*,
and *disease* categories excluded) was concrete (e.g. *colors*; *sports*; *units
of time*; *types of music* categories were excluded) with a high proportion of
respondents in the norming study producing the category. Proper nouns (car
companies, male/female names) were also excluded. This left the category: a type
of fabric:

```
